# MATPLOTLIB PROBLEM # 1
# Chicago Public Library Visitors by Month (25pts)
# open and read in the "chilib_visitors_2016" file into a list
# calculate (and make a list of) the total visitors to Chicago libraries each month.  Do not plot every library individually.  Find the total for all libraries and plot that.
# Additionally, add lines for the three most visited libraries.
# plot the total visitors on the y and month on the x.  You will have 4 separate lines (total and 3 libraries)
# add a legend
# label axes, title the graph
