# MATH OPERATORS AND VARIABLES (31PTS TOTAL)
# Knock the rust off your Python skills

# BASIC PROBLEMS 
#PROBLEM 1 (From Math Class to Code - 5pts)
# Print the answer to the math question:
# 3(60x^2 + 3x/9) + 2x - 4/3(x) - sqrt(x)
# where x = 12.83

x = 12.83
your_answer = 0  # Substitute your equation for the zero
print(your_answer)

#PROBLEM 2 (Wholesale Books - 5pts)
#The cover price of a book is $27.95, but bookstores get a 50 percent discount.
#Shipping costs $4 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy.
# Calculate the total wholesale costs for 68 copies to the nearest penny.

#PROBLEM 3 (Dining Room Chairs - 5pts)
# You purchase eight chairs for your dining room.
# You pay for the chairs plus sales tax at 9.5%
# Make a program that prints the amount to the nearest penny using the variables below
# Use the round(float, digits) function to get to nearest penny
chair_price = 189.99
tax_percent = 0.095
units = 8

# INTERMEDIATE PROBLEMS
#PROBLEM 2 (Set your alarm - 4pts)
#You look at the clock and see that it is currently 1:00PM.
# You set an alarm to go off 728 hours later.
# At what time will the alarm go off? Write a program that prints the answer.
# Hint: for the best solution, you will need the modulo operator.


#PROBLEM 6 (Variable Swap - 4pts)
# Can you think of a way to swap the values of two variables that does not
# need a third variable as a temporary storage?
# In the code below, try to implement the swapping of the values of 'a' and 'b' without using a third variable.
# To help you out, the first step to do this is already given.
# You just need to add two more lines of code.

a = 17
b = 23
print( "a =", a, "and b =", b)
a += b # this is the first line to help you out
# add two more lines of code here to cause swapping of a and b
print( "a =", a, "and b =", b)

#ADVANCED PROBLEM
#PROBLEM 7 (Coin counter - 3pts)
# Write code that classifies a given amount of money (which you store in a variable named count),
# as greater monetary units. Your code lists the monetary equivalent in dollars, quarters,
# dimes, nickels, and pennies.
# Your program should report the maximum number of dollars that fit in the amount,
# then the maximum number of quarters that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars,
# then the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars and quarters,
# and so on for nickels and pennies.
# The result is that you express the amount as the minimum number of coins needed.
