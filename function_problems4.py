#FUNCTIONS (14PTS TOTAL)

#PROBLEM 1 (how many upper case - 3pts)
# Make a function takes a string as a parameter, then prints how many upper case letters are contained in the string.
# A loop that compares each letter to the .upper() or .lower() of itself will suffice.
# Make a call to that function using "Francis W. Parker" (it should print "3")

# PROBLEM 2 (Biggest, smallest, average - 4pts)
# Make a function which takes 3 numbers as parameters.
# The function then prints the largest, the smallest, and their average, rounded to 2 decimals.
# Display the answers in a "nicely" formatted way.
# Make a call to your function.

# PROBLEM 3 (Random Numbers - 4pts)
# Use the random() and randrange() functions to perform the following
# Generate a random integer between -3 and 5 (-3 and 5 both included)
# Generate a random float between 4 and 6.

# PROBLEM 4 (add me, multiply me - 3pts)
# Make a function which takes in two integers and RETURNS their sum AND their product.
# Make a call to the function and capture the product and sum as variables.
