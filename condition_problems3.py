#CONDITIONS (15PTS TOTAL)

# PROBLEM 1 (GPA - 4pts)
# Grades are values between 0 and 100
# We will translate grades to letters.
# 90-100: A, 80-90: B, 70-80: C, 60-70: D, <60 F. (a grade of exactly 90 would be considered an A)
# Make a series of if/elif/else statements to print the letter grade.
# If the user enters a grade lower than zero or higher than 100, just give an error message.
# Don't worry about making an exception for these right now.

# PROBLEM 2 (Vowels - 5pts)
# Ask the user to supply a string.
# Print how many different vowels there are in the string.
# The capital version and lower case are considered the same vowel.
# Produce a proper output (e.g., printing “There are 1 different vowels in the string” is ugly).
# Example: When the user enters the string “It’s Owl Stretching Time.”
# the program should say that there are 3 different vowels in the string.

# PROBLEM 3 (Login - 6pts)
# Create a program which works according to the flow diagram PasswordFlowchart.png in this folder
# Substitute your name for Rohan's, and use whatever generic password you want.
