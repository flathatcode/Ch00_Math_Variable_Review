# Go to your favorite follow on Twitter.  (not someone who posts explicit materials please)
# Inspect their twitter feed.
# You'll notice that the tweets are stored in a ordered list <ol></ol>,
# and individual tweets are contained as list items <li></li>.
# Use BeautifulSoup and urllib to grab the text contents of the tweets
# located on the twitter page you chose.  The .text attribute will supply the content of a soup object.
# Have fun.  Again, nothing explicit. (15pts)
