Create a single recursive function (or more if you wish), which can answer the first three questions below.  For each question, make an appropriate call to the function. (5pts each)

#1.  You have $10000 on a high interest credit card with an APR of 20.0% (calculated MONTHLY, so MPR is APR/12).  Assuming you make no payments for 6 months, what is your new balance?  Solve recursively.

#2.  You have $5000 on a high interest credit card with an APR of 20.0% (calculated MONTHLY).  You make the minimum payment of $100 per month for 36 months.  What is your new balance?  Solve recursively.

#3.  You have $10000 on a high interest credit card with an APR of 20.0% (calculated MONTHLY).  If you make the minimum payment of $100 per month, how many months will it take to pay it off?  Solve recursively.






#4  Pyramid of Cubes - (10pts) If you stack boxes in a pyramid, the top row would have 1 box, the second row would have two, the third row would have 3 and so on.  Make a recursive function which calculates the TOTAL NUMBER OF BOXES for a pyramid of boxes n high.  For instance, a pyramid that is 3 high would have a total of 6 boxes.  A pyramid 4 high would have 10.
